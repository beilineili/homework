COMPUTER
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks

A computer is a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format.

COMPUTER SCIENCE
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale.

SOFTWARE
software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.
Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data

SOFEWARE ENGINEERING
Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method
"the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software"
"The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software"
"an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production
"the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines"

ALAN TURING
Alan Mathison Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality (which was then considered a crime in the UK). Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.

MOORE’S LAW
![a](https://github.com/beilineili/huangjzmhomework/blob/gh-pages/images/660px-Moore's_Law_Transistor_Count_1971-2016.png）
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Intel executive David House (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).
Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend and not a physical or natural law.
