# 我的第二次作业

## 一、进制转换

**\1. 1分12秒=（60+12）秒=72秒=7.2*（10^4） 毫秒**

 

**\2. （7A）13=7*（13^1）+10*（13^0）=91+10=（101）10**

 

**\3. （7A）16=7*（16^1）+10*（16^0）=112+10=（122）10**

 

**\4. （7A）16=（1111010）2=（172）8**

 

**\5. （1011011）2=（133）8=（5B）16**

 

**\6.  (678)10=(1010100110)2=(1246)8**

 

**\7.  (111)2+(101)2=(1000)2**

# Information

​    **Information is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.**

​      **Information is conveyed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.**

​     **Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation. It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.**





# Positional notation

​    **Positionalnotation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude. This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.****

 

​    **With the use of a radix point, the notation can be extended to include fractions and the numeric expansions of real numbers.**





# Algorithm

   **An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.****

   **An algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[6] and terminating at a final ending state. ****





# Software bug

​       A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of fixing bugs is termed **"debugging"**** and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.

 

​      Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's source code or its design, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective). Bugs can trigger errors that may have ripple effects. Bugs may have subtle effects or cause the program to crash or freeze the computer. Other bugs qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.
