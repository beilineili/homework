### （1）Logic gate 

​       **In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output。**

​      Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays (relay logic), fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.



### （2）Boolean algebra

​      In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which **the values of the variables are the truth values true and false**, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, **the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction** and denoted as ∧, the disjunction or denoted as ∨, and the negation not denoted as ¬. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that elementary algebra describes numeric relations.

​     Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)

​     Boolean algebra has been fundamental in the development of **digital electronics and is provided for in all modern programming languages.**
