## 1.

​    According to the von Neumann architecture，there are five basic parts of a computer.

##### (1).Central Processing Unit(contains Control Unit and Arithmetic/Logic Unit)

##### (2).Memory Unit(store a lot of programmers which are running)

##### (3).Input Device(Mouse,Cupboard)

##### (4).Output Device(Printer,Display)

## 2.

64MB=2^26 Byte

need 26 bits

## 3.

Control Unit,  Arithmetic Logic Unit,  Cache,  Data,  Bus

Yes.

## 4.

​     It is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device).

​    Such as *Flash memory*,*Optical disc,Magnetic Disk*,Magnetic tape.

#### (1)CPU

​    A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

#### (2)RAM

​      Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.

​     RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.

#### (3)ROM

​     Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

#### (4)BUS

​      In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

#### (5)Parallel computing

​     Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.

#### 云计算

​       云是网络、互联网的一种比喻说法。云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问，进入可配置的计算资源共享池（资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务）。通俗一点说，无论用户需要多少CPU，内存，硬盘的虚拟电脑，都可以在一个有着几千台机器的大池子里面，通过调度中心自动找一个能够满足用户需求的地方。把虚拟电脑启动起来做好配置，用户就直接能用了。

（1）DDR是内存的技术，‘3’指第三代的DDR内存，‘1333’指内存条的频率是1333MHZ

（2）不可以，主板允许内存条最大调用频率是1333MHZ，用1600MHZ内存条也只能调用1333MHZ

（3）可以，主板支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，CPU能指挥两个内存条分别独立工作，理论上能使内存的带宽增加一倍，数据存取速度也相应增加一倍。即性能会更好一点。

（4）16GB=2^34 Byte

   需要34位地址
