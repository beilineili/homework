### （1）Method of complements

 

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

 

The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend) two methods may be used:

 

1.the nines' complement of x is added to y. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.

 

2.the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leading digit '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ten's complement.

 

 

#### *The one’s complement

The ones' complement of a binary number is defined as the value obtained by inverting all the bits in the binary representation of the number (swapping 0s for 1s and vice versa). The ones' complement of the number then behaves like the negative of the original number in some arithmetic operations. To within a constant (of −1), the ones' complement behaves like the negative of the original number with binary addition. 

 

A ones' complement system or ones' complement arithmetic is a system in which negative numbers are represented by the inverse of the binary representations of their corresponding positive numbers. In such a system, a number is negated (converted from positive to negative or vice versa) by computing its ones' complement. 

 

The ones' complement binary numeral system is characterized by the bit complement of any integer value being the arithmetic negative of the value. That is, inverting all of the bits of a number (the logical complement) produces the same result as subtracting the value from 0.

#### *Two ‘s complement

two's complement has the advantage that the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication are identical to those for unsigned binary numbers (as long as the inputs are represented in the same number of bits, and any overflow beyond those bits is discarded from the result). This property makes the system simpler to implement, especially for higher-precision arithmetic. 

 

Conveniently, another way of finding the two's complement of a number is to

\1.      take its ones' complement and add one:

\2.      the sum of a number and its ones' complement is all '1' bits, or 2N − 1;

\3.      the sum of a number and its two's complement is 2N.

 

 

#### Sign extension

When turning a two's-complement number with a certain number of bits into one with more bits (e.g., when copying from a 1-byte variable to a 2-byte variable), the most-significant bit must be repeated in all the extra bits.

Similarly, when a two's-complement number is shifted to the right, the most-significant bit, which contains magnitude and the sign information, must be maintained. However, when shifted to the left, a 0 is shifted in.

 

## （2）Byte

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

 

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size – byte-sizes from 1[3] to 48 bits[4] are known to have been used in the past

 

## （3）integer(computer science)

In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits).

 

## (4)Floating point

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.

The term floating point refers to the fact that a number's radix point  can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number.

 

# 三、

1.

（1）证明：设十进制中I为小于b^n的一个正整数，b进制I的位数为n，则I+Negative（I）=b的n次方

 ![{\displaystyle b^{n}-1=(b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5ddbe8015de28f5f742fb47e01f8803970cc466)

I+(I)反码=（b-1)b^(n-1)+...+(b-1)    (即每一位都是b-1)=b^n -1

(I)反码+1=（I）补码

 所以Negative（I）=（I）反码+1=（I）补码



#### ** (2)x=-(00000017)8=-(00001111)2=(11110001)2=(761)8 （负数前面补1而不是0）**



2.

(1)x=-(00011111)2=(11100001)2=0xe1,y=225

(2)证明：因为y是int型的，所以可以把y=x=0xe1转换成y=225

 

\3. NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations，along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.
